#### Sometimes I stay up too late.

It's something I've always done. Usually it's just watching TV or playing video games.
Tonight it's Star Trek: The Next Generation and throwing together this website.

Let me tell you, TNG has aged.

After a pretty shaky start, it does seem like the show is starting to find it's feet. 
It's like the funding finally came through after the first 3 episodes and they were 
finally able to put some money into the costume department, instead of just making do with 
whatever was lying around after that stage production of Ben Hur.
